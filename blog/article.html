			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percent of the failures that occur are due to the fact there is no strong will. Many people simply say that they want something, but they do not make any attempt to achieve it. Thus, instead of getting it, they use the weakest excuses to explain the situation away.
			On many occasions, too, people probably say much more than the truth about difficulties, making the objective impossible to reach. In fact, if one has the will to succeed, then the size of the obstacles will seem smaller, and one can achieve one's goals. 
			we must accept finite disappointment , but we must never lose infinite hope.
